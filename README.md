This is side project built to run with Firebase Realtime Database.

Set up to solve the problem of having a way of remotely voting on stories without seeing each others votes before voting is complete.

[See my hosted version](https://storyvotes.web.app)

## Firebase credentials

You will need your own Firebase credentials, populate a .env file with the creds from your Firebase console

### `npm install`

You will need to run this first

### `npm start`

Should launch into a browser and will try and connect to firebase using your creds

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
